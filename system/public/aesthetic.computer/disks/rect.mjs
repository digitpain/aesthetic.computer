// Rect, 22.09.19.21.07
// Inherits from the "nopaint" system, which predefines boot, act, and leave.

/* #region âœ… TODO 
 - [ðŸŸ¡] Write the ideal "rect" brush code.
  - [ðŸŸ¢] Re-read brush code, squashing down the api bit by bit.
 + Done
 - [x] Starting a pan while mid stroke
       cancels the stroke but still stamps
       a rectangle when the pan ends and the mouse lifts. 
 - [x] Abstract "needsBake" into nopaint. 
 - [x] I need an abstraction to know whether we are making a brush
       stroke or not, in order to manage panning and drawing logic
       across platforms.
