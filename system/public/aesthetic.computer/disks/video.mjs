// Video, 23.1.26.12.01
// Play back and be able to export / upload a recorded video.

/* #region ✏️ todo
  + Now
  - [-] Factor out / modify the old video overlay UI thing to only work here. 

    - [💚] Show preview of video immediately when the piece loads if a video
          actually exists.

         It can be shown in a special DOM layer and this piece can have a clear
         backdrop with a few controls.

  - [] Add a "loop" and a "home" (back to title) button.
  - [] Take advantage of the dead time / transcoding time.
  - [] Show a little game or helpful hint. (💡 @alex)
  - [] Only transcode upon tapping export.
  - [] Would I be able hold onto / store the recording similar to a painting
       on the client? So that way refresh can work.
  + Done
  - [x] How to know when we have started printing immediately?
