// Play back and be able to export / upload a recorded video.

  + Now
  - [üòÄ] Fix recording visibility on iOS!
  - [] Add a "home" / button.
    - [] Transcode upon tapping export.
      - [] Then transcode & upload and reveal download options, based on
           device capability.

  - [-] Factor out / comment or modify the old video overlay UI code.
  - [] Would I be able hold onto / store the recording similar to a painting
       on the client? So that way refreshing the page can work...
  + Done
  - [x] Pressing "back" and then going "forward" should restart your recording,
  - [x] Show preview of video immediately when the piece loads if a video
        actually exists.
  - [x] It can be shown in a special DOM layer and this piece can have a clear
        backdrop with a few controls.
  - [x] How to know when we have started printing immediately?
  + Later
  - [] Make multi-scene recordings by not stopping a recording on back / 
       intentionally do multi-scene stuff, perhaps with different configurations
       of images even according to a rhythm, with preloaded piece source code.
  - [] Take advantage of the dead time / transcoding time.
    - [] Show a little game or helpful hint. (üí° @alex)
